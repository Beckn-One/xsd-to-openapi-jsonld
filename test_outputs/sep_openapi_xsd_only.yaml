The service provider can use flowRateStartLimit and flowRateEndLimit to describe the demand characteristics of the different rates.  Similarly, these attributes can be used to describe limits on premises DERs that might be producing a commodity and sending it back into the distribution network. \n\nNote: At the time of writing, service provider tariffs with demand-based components were not originally identified as being in scope, and service provider tariffs vary widely in their use of demand components and the method for computing charges.

          description: Target reactive power, in var. This control is likely to be more useful for aggregators, as individual DERs may not be able to maintain a target setting.

        opModVoltVar:
          description: Specify DERCurveLink for curveType == 11.  The static volt-var function provides over- or under-excited var compensation as a function of measured voltage. The volt-var curve is specified as an array of volt-var pairs that are interpolated into a piecewise linear function with hysteresis. The x value of each pair specifies an effective percent voltage, defined as ((locally measured voltage - setVRefOfs) / setVRef) and SHOULD support a domain of at least 0 - 135. If VRef is present in DERCurve, then the x value of each pair is additionally multiplied by (VRef / 10000). The y value specifies a target var output interpreted as a signed percentage (-100 to 100). The meaning of the y value is determined by yRefType and must be one of %setMaxW, %setMaxVar, or %statVarAvail.
        opModVoltWatt:
          description: Specify DERCurveLink for curveType == 12.  The Volt-Watt reduces active power output as a function of measured voltage. The Volt-Watt curve is specified as an array of Volt-Watt pairs that are interpolated into a piecewise linear function with hysteresis. The x value of each pair specifies an effective percent voltage, defined as ((locally measured voltage - setVRefOfs) / setVRef) and SHOULD support a domain of at least 0 - 135. The y value specifies an active power output interpreted as a percentage (0 - 100). The meaning of the y value is determined by yRefType and must be one of %setMaxW or %statWAvail.
        opModWattPF:
          description: Specify DERCurveLink for curveType == 13.  The Watt-PF function varies Power Factor (PF) as a function of delivered active power. The Watt-PF curve is specified as an array of Watt-PF coordinates that are interpolated into a piecewise linear function with hysteresis.  The x value of each pair specifies a watt setting in %setMaxW, (0 - 100). The PF output setting is a signed displacement in y value (PF sign SHALL be interpreted according to the EEI convention, where unity PF is considered unsigned). These settings are not expected to be updated very often during the life of the installation, therefore only a single curve is required.  If issued simultaneously with other reactive power controls (e.g. opModFixedPFInjectW) the control resulting in least var magnitude SHOULD take precedence.
        opModWattVar:
          description: Specify DERCurveLink for curveType == 14. The Watt-Var function varies vars as a function of delivered active power. The Watt-Var curve is specified as an array of Watt-Var pairs that are interpolated into a piecewise linear function with hysteresis. The x value of each pair specifies a watt setting in %setMaxW, (0-100). The y value specifies a target var output interpreted as a signed percentage (-100 to 100). The meaning of the y value is determined by yRefType and must be one of %setMaxW, %setMaxVar, or %statVarAvail.
